= Overview

Neo4j Code Graph is a Python toolkit and pipeline that turns a source code repository (and its Git history) into a queryable knowledge graph in Neo4j. Once ingested, you can ask targeted Cypher questions about security exposure, architectural bottlenecks, refactor candidates, co‑change/temporal coupling, and team expertise to drive engineering decisions.

What it solves:

- *Security and risk visibility*: surface vulnerable third‑party dependencies and where they intersect with public APIs or recent changes
- *Architecture and technical debt*: highlight hot files/methods by size/complexity and graph centrality to prioritize refactors
- *Temporal coupling and release risk*: identify files that frequently change together and recent change clusters
- *Team insights*: find subject‑matter experts by commit history

Key capabilities:

- *End‑to‑end pipeline with Prefect*: code analysis, Git history ingestion, similarity/centrality, CVE analysis, temporal coupling
- *Aura‑compatible analytics*: APOC core and standard GDS only
- *Batteries‑included querying*: catalog of Cypher patterns for coupling, risk, refactors, expert finding, executive summaries
- *Docs and guardrails*: CI builds docs, validates Cypher snippets against an ephemeral Neo4j, and publishes to GitHub Pages
